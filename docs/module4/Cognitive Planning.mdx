# Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language commands (e.g., "Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions

This chapter delves into cognitive planning, focusing on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate complex natural language commands into structured sequences of ROS 2 actions for robots.

## LLM Integration for Task Planning

Explore methods for integrating LLMs into robotic systems to enable high-level task planning from natural language inputs.

## Natural Language to ROS 2 Action Mapping

Learn techniques for breaking down natural language commands into a series of executable ROS 2 actions.

## Handling Ambiguity and Context

Understand strategies for dealing with ambiguity in natural language and incorporating contextual information into the planning process.
