# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. You will explore the foundational concepts, historical context, and future potential of intelligent robotic systems designed to interact with the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are embodied in physical forms, allowing them to perceive, interact with, and manipulate their physical environments. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI deals with the challenges of real-world physics, uncertainty, and dynamic interactions.

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics focuses on creating robots that resemble the human body, possessing similar locomotion, manipulation, and sensory capabilities. These robots are designed to operate in human-centric environments and perform tasks traditionally done by humans, opening up new possibilities in service, manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration.

## Key Learning Objectives

* Understand the core principles distinguishing Physical AI from other forms of AI.
* Grasp the fundamental components and capabilities of humanoid robots.
* Explore the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI, drawing from robotics, AI, machine learning, and cognitive science.
* Set the stage for deeper dives into specific technologies and applications covered in subsequent modules.
