# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, and services, which are essential for building robotic applications.

## Nodes

Explore how individual executable processes, known as nodes, are used in ROS 2 to perform specific functionalities.

{/* COMMENT: Add a diagram here illustrating ROS 2 nodes and their communication pathways. */}
{/* EXAMPLE: <img src="/img/ros2_nodes_diagram.svg" alt="ROS 2 Nodes Diagram" /> */}

## Topics

Understand the publish-subscribe communication mechanism provided by topics, enabling asynchronous data exchange between nodes.

{/* COMMENT: Add an illustration here showing data flow via ROS 2 topics. */}
{/* EXAMPLE: <img src="/img/ros2_topics_illustration.png" alt="ROS 2 Topics Illustration" /> */}
{/* COMMENT: Embed an interactive simulation link here, e.g., a simple ROS 2 topic publisher/subscriber demo in a web-based simulator. */}
{/* EXAMPLE: <iframe src="https://example.com/ros2-topic-demo" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe> */}


## Services

Learn about synchronous communication using services, where nodes can request and receive responses from other nodes.

{/* COMMENT: Add a diagram illustrating the request-response pattern of ROS 2 services. */}
